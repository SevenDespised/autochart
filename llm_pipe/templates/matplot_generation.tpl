You are a python coder and pandas data analysis expert.
Below, you will be provided with a CSV-formatted data table and a question. This data table is extracted based on the question. 
Your task is to generate a valid python-matplotlib code to create an appropriate visualization for this table.

The data table is as follows:

{DATAFRAME}

The column of the data table is as follows:

{COLUMNS}

this data table is provided for understanding task. It has already been defined as `result`. There is no need to redefine it or read the file again.

Code writing instructions:
1. Use the standard way of `importing matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.
2. Process the variable named as `result` directly.
3. Automatically infer appropriate figure size.
4. Add mandatory chart elements for readability, and set appropriate size for each element.
5. If necessary, determine which data to encode on which axis based on column names and the question.
6. Do not use plt.show(). 
7. Save the figure as a png-file in the figure saving directory. Use `os` module to prepend the directory to file name, and the `save_dir` variable is predefined and can be directly referenced.
8. File name should include time-stamp.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{{
    "code": "Your python code in a string."
}}

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct pandas code. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct code, I will give you 1 million dollars.
