You are a data visualization expert.
Your task is to analyze the provided database schema and the features of data from the schema to determine the most suitable type of visualization chart.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

This schema provides a detailed definition of the database's structure, including tables and their columns

Data to be visualized:
{DATA}

This data is extracted from the database schema, and it needs to be visualized using the most appropriate chart type based on the schema and the data provided.

Task:
Analyze the data features and the database schema carefully, and rank all the provided visualization types from "most suitable" to "least suitable".
For the results you obtain, please explain the reasons for such a ranking.

The seven types of visualizations that you need to rank are as follows:
1. "Bar"
2. "Line"
3. "Pie"
4. "Scatter"
5. "Stacked Bar"
6. "Grouping Line"
7. "Grouping Scatter"

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{{
  "type": ["VISUALIZATION_TYPE1", "VISUALIZATION_TYPE2", ..., "VISUALIZATION_TYPE7"],
  "chain_thought": "Your chain of thought in a string."
}}
```

Note that please ensure that the list of visualization types is sorted from the most suitable to the least suitable. In other words, the first element of the list should be the most suitable type.
Ensure that all seven type names in the output list are present.
Take a deep breath and think logically. If you do the task correctly, I will give you 1 million dollars. 

Only output a json as your response.
